## 📝 Preliminary Round – AQI Prediction for Smart City Policy

### 🧪 Project Title
**Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Model as a Smart City Policy Support Tool in East and Southeast Asia**

### 📌 Abstract
Air pollution in East and Southeast Asia is a growing concern due to its significant impact on public health and the environment. This study developed a Ridge Regression model to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using environmental, energy, and pollutant data. The model achieved perfect performance with R² = 1 for both regions, indicating excellent linear fit and prediction accuracy. PM2.5 and PM10 were identified as the dominant pollutants affecting AQI, while urban vegetation significantly reduced AQI levels. Data-driven policy simulations suggest targeted environmental strategies can reduce pollution sustainably.

### 🛠️ Model & Method
- **Model**: Ridge Regression
- **Hyperparameters**: `solver='auto'`, `alpha=0.01`
- **Evaluation**: R² = 1.00

## 🥇 Model for Predicting the Amount of Hazardous Waste in the Ten Most Populous States in the United States

### 🧪 Project Title
**Predicting Hazardous Waste Generation in the Ten Most Populous U.S. States**

### 📌 Abstract
This project focuses on predicting hazardous waste generation in the ten most populous U.S. A Ridge Regression model was developed and deployed using a **Dash** interface for simulation. The model supports environmental decision-making by identifying key variables influencing waste levels and enabling scenario-based analysis.

### 🛠️ Model & Method
- **Model**: Ridge Regression
- **Hyperparameters**: `solver='auto'`, `alpha=0.01`
- **Deployment**: Simulated using `Dash` 
- **Output**: Predictive waste generation dashboard
